# Stake PNL Tracker Userscripts

## Overview

This repository contains two userscripts designed to enhance your experience on Stake and its mirror sites by providing advanced Profit/Loss (PNL) tracking and statistics.

-   `pnl_tracker_enhanced.js`: A feature-rich script offering multi-session history, smart notifications for big wins, and a compact mini-mode for the PNL display.
-   `pnl_tracker_optimized.js`: A streamlined version focused on core PNL tracking with improved performance.

Both scripts track your PNL across multiple cryptocurrencies, provide detailed game-specific statistics, and allow you to export your data.
